##Crystal Face Rotations

1. First Year Theory
	 - Linear Algebra: Section 3.1 - Linear Tranformations
	 - Materials Science: Chapter 3.3 - Unit cells
	 - Computer Programming: Section 4.2 - Variables and Assignment
2. Cool Career Projects
	 - Able to use matrices in programs 
3. Cost
	 - Program: Free. Program is binded to the LGPL (Lesser General Public License)
	 - Computer: *insert cost of booking lab here*
4. Unique
	 - UofT game dev & UofT app dev club assume you know a significant amount of coding, and the programs created are much more complex.
5. Time
	 - Linear Algebra & Programming
	 - Explanation and Lecture: 20 minutes
	 - Calculations: 10 minutes
	 - Coding: 10 minutes
	 - Materials Science
	 - Lecture: 20 minutes
	 - Guessing: 30 minutes
	 - Total: 1 hour, 30 minutes
	 - 	Note: Advanced programmers could have additional assignments
6. Kinesthetic Learning
	 - Each student will have a program that deals with linear transformations
	 - Each student will have an aid to distinguish the unit cell faces
7. Accomodation
	 - 20+ participants. Depends on lab space
8. Venue
	 - General ECF labs
9. Applicability
	 - Different matrices produce different transformations
10. Design
	 - Different ways to code a single statement

Prerequisites: Linear Algebra?
Concerns: Gauging the programming level of participants
